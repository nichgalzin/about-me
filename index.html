            <h2>FROM CIRCUS...</h2>
            <p>More than twenty years ago I started volunteering with a local youth circus program in my home town of Chicago. Although I could hardly juggle, I could help with the homework part of the after school program they ran. It was a bonus that as a volunteer I had access to weekly acrobatics classes with an amazing coach. I was just 20 years old at the time and within a year I would have drop out of university, much to my parents chagrin, and be dedicating all my time to training and teaching circus- a choice that would shape a huge part of the next two decades of my life.</p> 
            <p>Although the cliché of running away with the circus is often used metaphorically I literally did, although the face of circus has drastically change since I started. Theatres, street clothes and dreamlike movement can probably replace canvas, sawdust and horses in my story as an artist. I did get to see many places and work with many amazing people along the way and always, teaching was a big part of my journey. Some highlights include working with Cirque Eloize (Montreal), Ockham’s Razor (London), Chamaleon Theatre (Berlin) and the Midnight Circus (Chicago).</p>
            <p>I relocated to London in 2011 and have lived here since. Since the pandemic I have not been performing but am still involved in the performing arts, working as a self-employed circus teacher and rigger mainly based out of the National Centre for Circus Arts in Shoreditch.</p>

            <h2 class="reverse">TO CODING:</h2>
            <p class="white-txt">My fascination with coding has sprung out of desire for a better understanding with the technologies that shape our life. It was during the first national lock down, armed with an abundance of free time, a feeling of wanting to find my next ‘thing’, and amazing free online learning resources, that I made my first real attempt at learning web development. I was immediately drawn to the presentation of ideas provided by front end web development and the creative potential of all the new tools I was learning. As normality encroached back into the world I put aside my learning and got on with life again. It was late 2022 that after a conversation with a friend who works in software development I realized I wasn’t done with coding.</p>
            <p class="white-txt">After more conversations with others who had retrained as developers I started to believe that this might be an industry I could actually work in and retrain to. One of the things I find most appealing about the tech industry is the narrative it tells about how anyone with some graft and learning can join it’s ranks. It’s a very inclusive idea, and although I know it to have it’s short falls, it still allows for the possibilities of dreaming. Organisations like Founders and Coders, a non-profit with inclusivity at the heart of it’s educational model, only makes me more excited about the potential of me working in a career that is both creative and inclusive</p>
