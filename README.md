# About this site
This website is a personal landing page built as part of my appliction for the Founders and Coders skills bootcamp. It's meant to showcase my progress learing to code
so for and to show case my current work. I also wanted to highlight my unique background in the performing arts and make a page that felt stylistically interesting and bold. 

## Some goals I had for this project:
-Envision and execute a bold styling for the site.
-Push the boundaries of making the site truly responsive to different device sizes.
- To learn more about making content trully A11y friendly.
