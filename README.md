# About this site
This website is a personal landing page built as part of my appliction for the Founders and Coders foundation course. It's meant to showcase my progress learing to code
so far and to showcase my current work projects. I also wanted to highlight my unique background in the performing arts and make a page that felt stylistically interesting and bold. 

## Some goals I had for this project:
-Envision and execute a bold styling for the site.
-Push the boundaries of making the site truly responsive to different device sizes.
- To learn more about making content A11y friendly.

## Site responsiness and design:
I had strong design goals for this sight and wanted it to look interesting on any screen. To this end I have experimented with some of the following:

  ### Units 
  - vw : Although I had previously used some other responsive untis such as em and rem, this was my first time working with vw / vh. <br>
  **What it does well**  <br>
  Sizing images and overlapping elements: Makes it super simple to keep overlapping design ideas looking great at any size. For example on this site the Keep Moving Foward inset always stays in the area of the underlying photo that I want it to. 
  <br> <br>
  **What it doesn't do great** <br>
  Although I used this unit for font sizing as well on this site, in hindsight I would have chosen a differently. At the extremes, things get to big or small respectively. Although I adjusted this with media quries, setting this with em or rem would have made this much simpler. 
  
### JS and resonsiveness 
- window.innerWidth This was great in setting conditionals to allow for styling that's being set by js at different screen widths, for example in the hamburger menu for this site.


## A11y:
### Accessible Hamburger Menu

### Semantic html
